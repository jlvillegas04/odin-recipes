    <h3>The perfect salty snack!</h3>
    <p>Onigiri is a traditional and widely popular Japanese dish that consists of Japanese sticky rice wrapped in savory nori. It is typically circular or triangular in shape and enjoyed in a bento box or as a yummy snack. These onigiri compliment udon or any other Japanese main course perfectly.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Rice </strong>
                - Japanese short grain rice is best for onigiri because it is both sticky and fluffy enough to retain its shape. The rice is also lightly salted for flavor.

                <strong>Nori </strong>
                - Nori is dried Japanese seaweed that is used to wrap the onigiri and keep the rice and tuna mayo filling together. Nori sheets also provides a makeshift handle to eat the onigiri and tastes delicious with the other ingredients.

                <strong>Kewpie Mayo </strong>
                - Kewpie mayo is a Japanese pantry staple and the base of spicy mayo. This Japanese mayonnaise has a rich umami flavor and creamy consistency. Kewpie mayo combines with the other ingredients to create a delicious onigiri tuna mayo.
