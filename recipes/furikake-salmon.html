    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Salmon filets</strong>
                - Salmon is one of the most nutritious types of fish to eat and has lots of health benefits. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12. It is naturally buttery with a mild fish taste.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Kewpie mayo</strong>
                - Unlike American mayonnaise, Kewpie mayo is made with only egg yolks instead of whole eggs and with either apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar with no added sugar or salt. Its texture is both richer and creamier than regular mayonnaise and it can be used as a standalone condiment just for its flavor.

                <strong>Garlic powder </strong>

                <strong>Furikake </strong>
                Furikake is a Japanese seaweed seasoning. The most common furikake is made of dried nori, or seaweed, sesame seeds, and salt. There are other types of furikake, which have bonito flakes, rice puffs, shrimp, and other bits of umami-packed ingredients.
